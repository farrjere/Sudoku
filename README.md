# Unit Convertor Manual

## 1. Introduction
Thank you for installing Unit Convertor.  The purpose of this app is to help you convert any standard measurement unit between different standards of measurement.  In the first release of this app we are only supporting basic distance, temperature, and weight conversions.  Specifically converting between kilometers and miles, celsius and fahrenheit, and kilograms and pounds will be supported.  In future releases we plan on adding additional distance, temperature, and weight conversions as well as speed, volume, area, fuel consumption, time, digital storage, and currency.  If after using the application for awhile you have any feedback or general concerns please contact help@unitconvertor.com.  Also, note that while in this initial release we are only supporting the Android platform future releases will support iPhone and Windows Phone. 

## 2. Launching Application
In order to launch the application click on the apps icon, typically located at the bottom of the screen, and go to the end of the applications searching for Unit Convertor.  Once you have found Unit Convertor just click on the app icon.

## 3. Choosing the type of conversion
Once the application has been launched you will be presented with a list of types of conversions (distance, temperature, and weight).  Simply choose the type of converison that you would like to perform and then press the corresponding button.  In order to get back to the main screen (where you select type of conversion), just press the back button.  The back button is typically represented as a curved arrow at the bottom of the screen.  

## 4. Converting units
In order to convert a specified unit to another just enter the value into the blank input box, located under one of the words Distance, Temperature, or Weight, then select the unit you would like to convert the input to.  Note that all answers are currently displayed with two decimal places, so depending on the conversion it is possible to not get exactly the same number you initially put in when converting back to the original units. Once the unit is selected, selecting the same unit again will not change the result.  

## 5. Troubleshooting
